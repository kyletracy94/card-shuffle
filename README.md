This project contains a representation of a Deck of cards, a Card, and various functions designed to
imitate dealing and shuffling the deck.

Building the project:
When attempting to build the project, navigate to the top directory in the project folder structure and type the following commands:

	$ ./gradlew build eclipse
	
That should build the project and also allow integration into an Eclipse editor.

The "card.shuffle.classes" package contains the objects that represent the Deck and its cards. There is also a test package that contains jUnit testing under the name "card.shuffle.test".
